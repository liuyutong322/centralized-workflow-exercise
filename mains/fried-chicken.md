# Crispy Fried Chicken Recipe

## Ingredients
- 4 chicken drumsticks (or 2 chicken breasts, halved)
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional for heat)
- 1 cup buttermilk (or 1 cup milk + 1 tablespoon lemon juice)
- 1 egg
- Vegetable oil for frying
- Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

## Instructions
### 1. Prepare the Chicken
- Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry with paper towels.
- In a shallow bowl, whisk together buttermilk and egg.

### 2. Create the Coating
- In another bowl, mix flour, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper.

### 3. Coat the Chicken
- Dip each chicken piece first in the buttermilk mixture, letting excess drip off.
- Then roll thoroughly in the flour mixture, pressing gently to adhere.
- Place on a wire rack and let rest for 15 minutes (this helps coating stick better).

### 4. Heat the Oil
- Pour oil into a deep skillet or Dutch oven to a depth of 1-2 inches.
- Heat over medium-high heat until it reaches 350째F (175째C), or until a pinch of flour sizzles immediately.

### 5. Fry the Chicken
- Carefully add chicken pieces to the hot oil, 2-3 at a time (don't overcrowd).
- Fry for 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).
- Remove with tongs and drain on a wire rack or paper towels.

### 6. Final Touches
- Sprinkle with a pinch of salt while still hot.
- Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.

### 7. Serve
- Best served immediately with sides like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or biscuits.

## Tips
- For extra crispiness: Double-coat by repeating the buttermilk and flour steps.
- No thermometer? The oil is ready when a wooden spoon handle dipped in forms small bubbles around it.
- Leftovers? Reheat in an air fryer or oven to maintain crispness.
